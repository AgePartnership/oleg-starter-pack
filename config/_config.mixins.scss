/* # Mixins

This file contains a collection of mixins available for use in your Sass.

Ideally, all mixins should be declared here but in some cases, they've been declared within an appropriate context. For example, the typography partial (config/_typography.scss) contains mixins controlling general site-wide font sizes.
