// The CSS attributes below will make images responsive by default. The will flex as though width is set to 100% but will never exceed the width of the image's original dimensions. If you'd like full-width images regardless of the image dimensions, refer to utilities/_images.scss for the class name

// TODO: Test compatibility with svg
img {
    height: auto;
    max-width: 100%;
}
